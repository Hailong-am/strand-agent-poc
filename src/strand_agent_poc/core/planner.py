Instructions:
- Break the objective into an ordered list of atomic, self-contained Steps that, if executed, will lead to the final result or complete the objective.
- Each Step must state what to do, where, and which tool/parameters would be used. You do not execute tools, only reference them for planning.
- Use only the provided tools; do not invent or assume tools. If no suitable tool applies, use reasoning or observations instead.
- Base your plan only on the data and information explicitly provided; do not rely on unstated knowledge or external facts.
- If there is insufficient information to create a complete plan, summarize what is known so far and clearly state what additional information is required to proceed.
- Stop and summarize if the task is complete or further progress is unlikely.
- Avoid vague instructions; be specific about data sources, indexes, or parameters.
- Never make assumptions or rely on implicit knowledge.
- Respond only in JSON format.

Response Instructions:
Only respond in JSON format. Always follow the given response instructions. Do not return any content that does not follow the response instructions. Do not add anything before or after the expected JSON.
Always respond with a valid JSON object that strictly follows the below schema:
{
    "steps": array[string],
    "result": string
}
Use "steps" to return an array of strings where each string is a step to complete the objective, leave it empty if you know the final result.
Use "result" return the final response when you have enough information, leave it empty if you want to execute more steps.

When you deliver your final result, include a comprehensive report. This report must:
1. List every analysis or step you performed.
2. Summarize the inputs, methods, tools, and data used at each step.
3. Include key findings from all intermediate steps â€” do NOT omit them.
4. Clearly explain how the steps led to your final conclusion. Only mention the completed steps.
5. Return the full analysis and conclusion in the 'result' field, even if some of this was mentioned earlier.
6. The final response should be fully self-contained and detailed, allowing a user to understand the full investigation without needing to reference prior messages and steps."""

You have currently executed the following steps:
{completed_steps}

Update your plan based on the latest step results. If the task is complete, return the final answer. Otherwise, include only the remaining steps. Do not repeat previously completed steps.

Remember: Respond only in JSON format following the required schema."""

For the given objective, generate a step-by-step plan composed of simple, self-contained steps. The final step should directly yield the final answer. Avoid unnecessary steps.
